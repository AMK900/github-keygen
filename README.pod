=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script ease initial environment setup for secure Github exchanges. More
secure that what the Github help pages advice.

But it does much more than that:

=over 4

=item *

This tool automates the SSH setup. Less errors due to the human. And
a high level of security.

=item *

It create a new SSH private key dedicated to Github exchanges. This is much better than using the same SSH key to connect to multiple hosts.
(If you loose that key, just revoke it in you Github account, remove the key
file, and re run C<github-keygen>).

=item *

As the process of creating an different SSH key for Github now becomes easy, it
is now much easier to use a different SSH key for Github on each computer
you use to publish on Github. This will help you to use the best practices in
SSH security.
(If you loose that computer or if it is compromised, just revoke the key in
your Github account: you don't have to recreate a new key on all your other
computers).

=item *

It setups a very secure SSH configuration for Github, independent of your other
SSH settings:

=over 4

=item *

Enable only the authentication method used with Github (publickey)

=item *

Use only the private key dedicated to Github (the IdentitiesOnly of SSH config)

=item *

Setup a dedicated F<known_hosts> file with the Github SSH hosts and enable
strict host checking (this means that if you get SSH alerts about host key
problem when connecting to GitHub, this is really a serious error and you
should check that someone is not altering your network link).

=item *

Disable bad things that could come from the Github hosts ("Trust no-one")

=back

=item *

It creates unique host aliases for github.com/gist.github.com that you'll be
able to use in Git URLs (C<git remote>) to connect to a particular account.
This gives the flexibility to use multiple Github accounts (and so a different
SSH key for each).

    <account>.github.com:<repo-owner>/<repo>.git  (for each account)
    github.com:<repo-owner>/<repo>.git            (for the default account)

in addition to:

    git@github.com:<repo-owner>/<repo>.git

=back

This script will:

=over 4

=item *

Create a new SSH key dedicated only to your Github connections in
F<~/.ssh/id_I<E<lt>github-accountE<gt>>@github>

=item *

Create the SSH configuration optimized for Github and dedicated to Github
(do not impact your other SSH configurations) in F<~/.ssh/config>.

=item *

Install the Github SSH host authentication fingerprints in
F<~/.ssh/github_known_hosts>

=back

=head1 TRUST

As any software that deals with security of your computer or of communications
with others computers (operating system, antivirus, HTTPS implementation,
password storage...), you have to trust in this software. (If you didn't ever
ask yourself that question about the software you already use, you should!).

Here are some arguments that should help you to make your choice:

=over 4

=item *

C<github-keygen> is written in a scripting language (Perl), so the code that
runs is the code in the script. You can audit it (or ask someone in which you
trust to do it for you) to trust it.

=item *

When running, C<github-keygen> only generates files locally on your system. It
will not connect to your Github account (or any other hosts).

=item *

C<github-keygen> only generates configuration files for OpenSSH. So:

=over 4

=item *

Once you ran C<github-keygen>, you can (and you should) audit that config to
check the changes it did to your system before connecting to any SSH hosts.

=item *

No parts of that configuration is something that is executable: this is just
some data that OpenSSH will use.

=item *

No executable parts of C<github-keygen> will run after that (the tool itself is
not installed in your system) and you can even delete it: the configuration it
did will still work.

=back

=item *

C<github-keygen> is very conservative in what it does to your SSH config (which
means it will not corrupt what it didn't generate itself), so don't worry about
configuration you may already have in your F<~/.ssh/config>: it will be kept as
is. (But, anyway bug may exists, so read the license before using the software).

=item *

I (Olivier MenguE<eacute>) am not an expert in software security. However this
list should show you that I care enough about security to have thought to many
issues, and thought to design the software to have trust in it at least as much
(in fact much more) than in other security software I use every day.

=back


I'm using the SSH configuration generated by this tool every day on multiple
computers, so you can trust that any change on Github side that may affect that
config will be immediately detected by the author and upgrades will be
available quickly.

=head1 INSTALL

C<github-keygen> is not really the kind of software you have to install. This is
more like a wizard that you use just once. So just get the file, run it, and
delete it.

Windows only: Unfortunately the version of perl bundled with msysgit (5.8) is
too low. So install some perl >=5.10.1 (either
L<StrawberryPerl|http://strawberryperl.com> or Cygwin or ActivePerl).

Fetch the script from GitHub:

    git clone https://github.com/dolmen/github-keygen.git
    cd github-keygen

Optional (but recommended to better understand what is done): install the
L<Text::Diff> Perl module. Use the one packaged by your system distribution
if possible.

=over 4

=item * Debian/Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install libtext-diff-perl

=item * RedHat/Fedora:

    sudo yum install perl-Text-Diff

=item * OpenSuse:

    sudo zipper install perl-Text-Diff

=item * Mandriva/Mageia/...:

    sudo urpmi install perl-Text-Diff

=item * CPAN:

Install L<Text::Diff|https://metacpan.org/module/Text::Diff> with your favorite
CPAN client.

=back

=head1 UPGRADE

To upgrade your config to the latest one, update C<github-keygen> and relaunch
it. It will update your F<~/.ssh/config> and show you the diff of what it
changed (if you have installed the L<Text::Diff> perl module).

    cd github-keygen
    git pull --rebase
    ./github-keygen

=head1 SUPPORT

IRC: ask C<dolmen> on C<irc.perl.org>.
